# Counter App using React
This is a simple app I created on Day 3 of learning React. The app has a number (starting at zero) and two buttons: one to increase the number and one to decrease it. When I click the buttons, the number updates immediately.

## What I Learned:
React Basics: I used something called a "component" to create the app.
Managing State: I learned how to store and update the number using useState.
Button Clicks: The buttons update the number when clicked, teaching me how to handle user actions in React.
